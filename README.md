# WIP: Comparing NLP model activations with brain MRI images

This is the dissertation project where we used [`VATT`](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/vatt)
 pre-trained model ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11178))

## Installation

If a previous installation of ``ffmpeg`` package is already present, it should be removed before continuing, in order to avoid conflicts.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Correspondence and Maintenance

Any feedback is appreciated. If you observed any issues, please contact us.
